        Shopping foods online is different from shopping other things online. <br>
        <br> To stimulate more thinking and enrich potential future research imagination, this paper reviews for online food shopping features, offers a commentary, and proposes future research directions.<br>
        <br> The propositions include the following:<br>
        <br> (1) The design and implementation of online food shopping (eco)systems should engage the consumers and other stakeholders to co-create collective and social values;<br>
        
        <br>(2) A better fit between technologies’ and food businesses’ natures could generate better applications for online food shopping; <br>
        <br>(3) A business model with sound finance systems becomes the core of a healthy online food ecosystem; <br>
        <br>(4) The interaction and transformation between online (virtual) and offline (virtual) food businesses determines the dynamic development of future food shopping.</p>
